Drawl is the world's best drawing language.
--

Drawl is an object-oriented domain-specific language for creating vector graphics using Java.
In comparison to alternatives like TikZ/PGF, Asymptote, and Processing/Processing.js, Drawl has one clear advantage:
all dimensions are relative.
This means that you don't need to explicitly place objects at particular coordinates,
something you might not know in advance without a lot of planning.
Instead, you place objects relative to each other.
This is a more intuitive way to draw.
The only other drawing language that has this feature is Diagrams, which is written in Haskell.

== Example

Here's a simple example.
The following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.aarrelaakso.drawl.examples;

import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Circle;
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Drawing;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ThreeCirclesHorizontal
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
        Circle circle1 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle1);
        Circle circle2 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle2);
        circle2.setRightOf(circle1);
        Circle circle3 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle3);
        circle3.setRightOf(circle2);
        drawing.writeToFile("ThreeCirclesHorizontal.svg", 200, 70);
    }
}
----

Gives us a drawing with three horizontally adjacent circles:

Note how we did not have to specify any coordinates to lay out this drawing.
The only numbers we used were to specify the desired size of the final drawing.
Moreover, by simply changing `setRightOf()` to `setAbove()` as follows:

[source,java]
----
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Circle;
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Drawing;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ThreeCirclesVertical
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
        Circle circle1 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle1);
        Circle circle2 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle2);
        circle2.setAbove(circle1);
        Circle circle3 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle3);
        circle3.setAbove(circle2);
        drawing.writeToFile("src/main/java/com/aarrelaakso/drawl/examples/ThreeCirclesVertical.svg", 70, 200);
    }
}
----

We get a drawing with three vertically adjacent circles instead!

Again, no explicit coordinates were specified.

= User's Guide

This part contains information useful for Drawl users.

== Arrowheads


== Port

The notion of a '''port''' in Drawl draws from similar notions in several other packages.

== Version History

=== Version 0.3.0 - June 1, 2020

* Text
* Lines and arrows

=== Version 0.2.0 - May 1, 2020

* Squares and rectangles
* Adjacencyâ€”left, right, above, below
* Fill and stroke

=== Version 0.1.0 - April 8, 2020

* Circles

= Developer's Manual
[partintro]
--

This part contains information necessary for software developers working on Drawl.
This information is not necessary for end users who are making diagrams.

--

== Coding Conventions

Regarding method names, we follow the following convention:

* asX takes an object of one type and creates a view of that object of a different type.
* getX gets a property of the object.
* toX takes an input object and creates a new object of a different type, initialized by the input object.
* xValue - Converts to a primitive type.
For example, `BigDecimal` has methods `doubleValue`, `floatValue`, `intValue`, `longValue`, and so on.

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25610624/java-method-naming-conventions-totype-and-astype-differences

== Release Process

1. Check in all files
2. Push to origin
3. Create release in GitHub
4. Update the version number in Doxyfile
5. Run Doxygen to update API documentation
6. Pushed updated documentation to GitHub Pages


= Design Philosophy
[partintro]
--
This part documents the design philosophy behind Drawl.

There are a number of alternatives to Drawl.
Several of them are tightly integrated with LaTeX. In this regard, https://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/[pstricks]
and TikZ are especially noteworthy.
There are also the standard LaTex {picture} environment, the xypic package, the dratex package, the metapost program,
and the xfig program.

Others stand alone to various degrees.
These include Asymptote, Graphviz, Diagrams, and ggplot.

== There's More Than One Way To Do It

In general, Drawl allows users to do things in several different ways rather than forcing them to
do things in only one way. The system of lineEnding types is a good example.

== Arrows

=== Asymptote

The Asymptote documentation cite:[Hammerlindl_Bowman_Prince] does not say much about arrowheads, but it appears there are four types:
`DefaultHead`, `SimpleHead`, `HookHead`, and `TeXHead`.

=== Graphviz

Graphviz offers 41 unique arrowheads and allows using them in combination, for more than 3 million possible configurations cite:[Graphviz_Arrow_Shapes].

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarre/drawl/master/docs/adoc/images/arrowheads-graphviz.png[Graphviz arrowheads,350,350]

=== PSTRicks

PSTricks offers 14 types of arrowheads, as follows (ignoring line ending options) cite:[Van_Zandt_2007]:


image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aarre/drawl/master/docs/adoc/images/arrowheads-pstricks.png[Arrowheads in PSTricks,350,350]

=== TikZ/PGF

TikZ/PGF offers a large number of parameterized arrow types.cite:[Tantau_2017].
