= Drawl Documentation
Aarre Laakso <aarre.laakso@gmail.com>

There are a number of '''alternatives''' to Drawl.

Several of them are tightly integrated with LaTeX. In this regard, [https://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/ pstricks] and TikZ are especially noteworthy. There are also the standard LaTex {picture} environment, the xypic package, the dratex package, the metapost program, and the xfig program.

Others stand alone to various degrees. These include Asymptote, Graphviz, and Diagrams.

== Arrows

=== Asymptote

The Asymptote documentation<<asymptote>> does not say much about arrowheads, but it appears there are four types:
`DefaultHead`, `SimpleHead`, `HookHead`, and `TeXHead`.

=== Graphviz

Graphviz offers 41 unique arrowheads and allows using them in combination, for more than 3 million possible
configurations.<<graphviz-arrows>>
