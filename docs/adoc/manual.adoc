Drawl is the world's best drawing language.

Welcome to the drawl wiki! Drawl is the world's best drawing language.

== Example

Here's a simple example. The following code:

[source,java]
----
package com.aarrelaakso.drawl.examples;

import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Circle;
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Drawing;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ThreeCirclesHorizontal
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
    {
        Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
        Circle circle1 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle1);
        Circle circle2 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle2);
        circle2.setRightOf(circle1);
        Circle circle3 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle3);
        circle3.setRightOf(circle2);
        drawing.writeToFile("src/main/java/com/aarrelaakso/drawl/examples/ThreeCirclesHorizontal.svg", 200, 70);
    }
}
----

Gives us a drawing with three horizontally adjacent circles:

Note how we did not have to specify any coordinates to lay out this drawing. The only numbers we used were to specify the desired size of the final drawing. Moreover, by simply changing `setRightOf()` to `setAbove()` as follows:

[source,java]
----
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Circle;
import com.aarrelaakso.drawl.Drawing;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ThreeCirclesVertical
{
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Drawing drawing = new Drawing();
        Circle circle1 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle1);
        Circle circle2 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle2);
        circle2.setAbove(circle1);
        Circle circle3 = new Circle();
        drawing.add(circle3);
        circle3.setAbove(circle2);
        drawing.writeToFile("src/main/java/com/aarrelaakso/drawl/examples/ThreeCirclesVertical.svg", 70, 200);
    }
}
----

We get a drawing with three vertically adjacent circles instead!

Again, no explicit coordinates were specified.

= Design Philosophy
[partintro]
--
This part documents the design philosophy behind Drawl.

There are a number of alternatives to Drawl.

Several of them are tightly integrated with LaTeX. In this regard, [https://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi/ pstricks] and TikZ are especially noteworthy. There are also the standard LaTex {picture} environment, the xypic package, the dratex package, the metapost program, and the xfig program.

Others stand alone to various degrees. These include Asymptote, Graphviz, and Diagrams.

== Arrows

=== Asymptote

The Asymptote documentation<<asymptote>> does not say much about arrowheads, but it appears there are four types:
`DefaultHead`, `SimpleHead`, `HookHead`, and `TeXHead`.

=== Graphviz

Graphviz offers 41 unique arrowheads and allows using them in combination, for more than 3 million possible
configurations.<<graphviz-arrows>>

=== PSTRicks

PSTricks offers 14 types of arrowheads, as follows (ignoring line ending options):<<pstricks>>

=== TikZ/PGF

TikZ/PGF offers a large number of parameterized arrow types.<<tigzpgf>>
